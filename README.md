This project combines a Denoising Autoencoder for imbalanced data classification with a modified Deep Convolutional Neural Network for enhanced Persian/Arabic handwritten digit recognition. Through rigorous simulations and experimentation, this integrated model exhibits outstanding performance, providing a versatile and robust solution to machine learning challenges. Its heightened accuracy and adaptability make it an ideal choice for tasks involving imbalanced datasets and character recognition in Persian and Arabic scripts, such as OCR applications and digit-based systems.
